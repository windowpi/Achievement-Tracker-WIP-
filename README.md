# Achievement-Tracker-WIP-

## My take on a achievement tracker and hopefully get Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 going soon.

If you would like to see my progress you can goto https://windowpi.github.io/Achievement-Tracker-WIP-/

This probably will look a lot like roundtables.net, as that is the inspiration for this project. I got the idea to do an achievement tracker for the Dark Souls series as I could not find one.

For me to learn and stay engaged with web site development, I am trying to "copy" roundtables.net in styling and layout but with my own twist on things I don't like from the site. As well as make it over a couple games not just Elden Ring.

Eventually I would like to make the website grab an achievement list from Steam or another online source and be able to track achievements that way. But I have no idea if that is even possible without hard coding all the achievement lists.

If you want to help or think I can write my code better, please do inform me.
